# Installing tools

You can install any tool by dragging its folder (or a zip file with the `.xrnx` extension and the tool's contents) onto Renoise. You can also copy the folder manually into your Tools folder.

> [!NOTE] 
> When creating a zip file you should only zip the **contents** of the folder, not the folder itself

<!-- If you can use a terminal, you can run the following commands to do this automatically. -->
<!-- TODO nicer zip command? -->

After you've installed a tool, it will be activated automatically. When in doubt, click the *Tools / Reload All Tools*.
