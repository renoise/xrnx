# Distribution

Eventually you might want to share your work with others, in this case you will have to use the zipped format.

* First, we recommend sharing your tool on the [Tools section of the forum](https://forum.renoise.com/c/renoise-tools) to get some feedback and early testing done. If you create a topic there, you can also use it to notify users about updates or discuss potential improvements.
* Later on, you might want to [submit your tool](https://www.renoise.com/tools/submit) to the official [Tool library](https://www.renoise.com/tools) so that users can find it easier and have automatic updates.
<!-- TODO add details about the submission process here? -->

# Community channels

* [The official Renoise forum has a dedicated topic](https://forum.renoise.com/c/renoise-tool-development)
