## Properties
### value : [`CheckBoxBoolean`](#CheckBoxBoolean) {#value}
> The current state of the checkbox, expressed as boolean.
> * Default: false

### active : [`ControlActive`](#ControlActive) {#active}
> Instead of making a control invisible, you can also make it inactive.
> Deactivated controls will still be shown, and will still show their
> currently assigned values, but will not allow changes. Most controls will
> display as "grayed out" to visualize the deactivated state.

### midi_mapping : [`ControlMidiMappingString`](#ControlMidiMappingString) {#midi_mapping}
> When set, the control will be highlighted when Renoise's MIDI mapping dialog
> is open. When clicked, it selects the specified string as a MIDI mapping
> target action. This target acton can either be one of the globally available
> mappings in Renoise, or those that were created by the tool itself.
> Target strings are not verified. When they point to nothing, the mapped MIDI
> message will do nothing and no error is fired.

### visible : [`ViewVisibility`](#ViewVisibility) {#visible}
> Set visible to false to hide a view (make it invisible without removing
> it). Please note that view.visible will also return false when any of its
> parents are invisible (when its implicitly invisible).
> * Default: true

### width : [`ViewDimension`](#ViewDimension) {#width}
> The dimensions of a view has to be larger than 0.
> For nested views you can also specify relative size
> for example `vb:text { width = "80%"}`. The percentage values are
> relative to the view's parent size and will automatically update on size changes.

### height : [`ViewDimension`](#ViewDimension) {#height}
> The dimensions of a view has to be larger than 0.
> For nested views you can also specify relative size
> for example `vb:text { width = "80%"}`. The percentage values are
> relative to the view's parent size and will automatically update on size changes.

### tooltip : [`ViewTooltip`](#ViewTooltip) {#tooltip}
> A tooltip text that should be shown for this view on mouse hover.
> * Default: "" (no tip will be shown)

### views : [`renoise.Views.View`](../../API/renoise/renoise.Views.View.md)[] {#views}
> **READ-ONLY** Empty for all controls, for layout views this contains the
> layout child views in the order they got added
