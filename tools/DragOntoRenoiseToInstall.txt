To try out the example tools you have to install them first. 

This can be done by dragging the com.renoise.ExampleTool.xrnx and 
com.renoise.ExampleToolGui.xrnx folders onto the running Renoise window. 

The installed tools will create two menu entries in Renoises "Tool" menu:
"Tools -> Example Tool" and
"Tools -> Example Tool GUI"
