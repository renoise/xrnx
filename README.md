## Renoise Scripting Development

Welcome to the Renoise Lua Scripting Repository! This site is for developers who want to write their own scripts & tools for [Renoise](http://www.renoise.com/). If you are only interested in downloading tools for Renoise and not in developing your own, please have a look at the [Renoise Tools Page](http://tools.renoise.com/).

### Getting Started

Read the [Renoise Scripting Development Book](https://renoise.github.io/xrnx)

This book is highly recommended for anyone who wants to get into all this Renoise scripting. Please read it first to get an overview of what's needed to develop tools for Renoise. It contains an introduction, some guides and the full API documentation.

### Example tools

In addition to the documentation, this repository also contains some sample tools in the [tools folder](./tools) that are intended for new tool developers only. You can download them, install them, and read them as an interactive tutorial.

See https://github.com/renoise/tools for tools created by the Renoise team that actually do something. 

### Need more help?

For any questions regarding the Lua API or this repository, please have a look at the [Renoise Scripting Development Forum](https://forum.renoise.com/c/renoise-tool-development).

*Have fun scripting and hacking Renoise!
